Prerequisites:

 * CVS and git clients
 * Recent (as of 2012-02-01) checkout of cvs2svn (r5379 is required)
   from http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/svn/cvs2svn/trunk cvs2svn-trunk
   (user name is 'guest', password empty)
 * tarball of PostgreSQL JDBC driver CVS repository from http://ejurka.com/pgsql/tmp

Steps:

1. Set CVS2GIT_HOME to point to the root of the cvs2svn checkout

    export CVS2GIT_HOME=/path/to/cvs2svn

2. Patch cvs2git with the patch included here

    patch -p0 -d "$CVS2GIT_HOME"  < surrogate-root.patch

3. Run the main conversion script

    ./convert.sh ../pgjdbc-2012-01-20.tar.gz

   The tail end of the output should look something like this:

     ~/jdbc-to-git/pgjdbc2git
     Cloning into 'pgjdbc-checkout'...
     done.
     Switched to a new branch 'REL6_4'
     Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
     To /home/maciek/jdbc-to-git/pgjdbc2git/pgjdbc.git
      + 0739984...45912ad REL6_4 -> REL6_4 (forced update)
     Switched to branch 'master'
     Deleted branch REL6_4 (was 45912ad).

4. Run the tag validation script, making sure to set the CVSROOT environment
   variable to point to the cvs-repo directory:

     CVSROOT=$PWD/cvs-repo ./verify-tags.sh

   The tail end of the output should look something like this:

     Previous HEAD position was 868b04c... Change version to 9.1-901 for release.
     HEAD is now at 5b19855... The getColumns() method in DataBaseMetaData.java returns a column size of -1 for varchar's.
     ~/jdbc-to-git/pgjdbc2git

5. Run the post-validation keyword cleanup script:

     ./verify-tags.sh

   The tail end of the output should look something like this:

     Switched to branch 'master'
     Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
     Deleted branch squash-keywords (was 6ed0e77).

6. You should now be able to clone from the pgjdbc.git repository, and "install"
   the repository somewhere else by running "git push --mirror $URL" from pgjdbc.git.
